				For the first day of class, we have the HTC Vive set up and a few Leap Motions for you to play with to learn about what types of Virtual Reality experiences you can aspire to create in this course.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the first two weeks, you will be doing Lab 0. Choose either Unreal Engine or Unity and follow the tutorial on this website, then see the project and grading rubric listed on Labssignment 0.
				</p>
				<p>This introductory project will be due during the week of 1/23/2017 and should be a fun starting point for you in this course.</p>
